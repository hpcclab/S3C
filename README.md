#S3C
1. After cloning or downloading project, open SemanticSearchEdge and SemanticSearchCloud in an IDE.
1.5. Some IDEs require you to re-PATH each and every .jar file that we are using in the lib folder of SemanticSearchEdge. If this happens to you, instead get the project from the S3C-Master zip files and Import from ZIP... into your IDE.
2. If running in an IDE:
	* Run SemanticSearchCloud
	* Run SemanticSearchEdge and follow key inputs for desired results
3. If running in terminal with .jars:
	* java -jar SemanticSearchCloud.jar
	* java -jar SemanticSearchEdge.jar
	* following the key inputs for desired results
Note: I do not know how to make a .sh file, sorry.
